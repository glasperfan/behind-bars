1. It does follow the guidelines discussed in class. 
  * **Response:** yay!
2. Can you make the pie/bar charts more interesting? Animation on click or scroll?
  * **Response:** yes. We’re looking into adding animation so that the visualizations “draw themselves out” as they come into view. See [here](https://www.nextbigsound.com/industryreport/2014) for example of animated visualizations.
3. Focus on interactivity on the state map. Other visualizations are largely static.
  * **Response:** Definitely. The geographical visualization will be our visualization of focus. You will be able to click on states, which will interactively affect pie charts, bar charts, and tables that display data related to that state. Unfortunately, do the difficulty of finding time for multiple years (we only have 2012 and 2013), we will not be adding a time scale.
4. Use saturation to display various variables on the geographical visualization.
  * **Response:** That is a great idea that we didn’t think about before. We’re going to add this to our visualization, so for example: being able to filter for males aged 35-50, of black or Hispanic descent, and having states be saturated based on the percentage of prisoners who fit those criteria. This would be more useful than simply displaying comparisons between proportions of races, age ranges, or sexes in states (which may end up being more similar than expected.)
5. Comparing between percentages of populations vs. between subsections of variables 
  * **Response:** We would need to get data on state populations, but this is certainly possible. 


####After: 

_Was the feedback fair? Helpful?_

Definitely! They had a lot of good ideas about how to make our “storyboard” more interactive and responsive. I think we’ll focus mainly on the geographic visualization, which will also be the most difficult piece to implement.

It was fairly useful to get another set of eyes on our idea, and to hear from different points of view. Because we have been bouncing ideas off of each other, it was nice to hear constructive criticism, especially regarding the visualization of variables across the geographical visualization.
